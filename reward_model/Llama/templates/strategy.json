(2) encouraging the speaker by saying something positive or complimentary. (3) emphasizing the speaker's control, freedom of choice, autonomy, and ability to decide. (4) statements of compassion or sympathy.\nMI Non-Adherent includes: (1) making suggestions, offering solutions or possible actions without first obtaining permission from the speaker (2) directly and unambiguously disagreeing, arguing, blaming, criticizing, or questioning the speaker's honesty. (3) giving orders, commands, or imperatives. (4) statement or event that warns of something or that serves as a cautionary example.\nOther includes any other expression, such as (1) the supporter discloses his/her personal information or experiences. (2) questions that can be answered with a yes/no response or a very restricted range of answers. (3) questions that allow a wide range of possible answers. (4) repetition, rephrasing, or paraphrasing of the seeker's previous statement. (5) repeating or rephrasing the previous statement of the speaker but adding substantial meaning/emphasis to it. (6) educating, providing feedback, or giving an opinion without advising.\nIndentify the response strategy of the supporter in the input conversation.",
