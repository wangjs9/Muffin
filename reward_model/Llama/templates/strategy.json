  "instruction": "Motivational Interviewing involves three distinct strategies. Each strategy can be described as follows:\n\n1. MI Adherent Strategies:\n* Advising: Providing advice when directly requested by the Help-seeker. This may include indirect forms of permission, such as when the Supporter says to disregard the advice as appropriate.\n* Encouraging: Offering positive remarks or compliments to the Help-seeker.\n* Emphasizing Autonomy: Highlighting the Supporter's control, freedom of choice, and ability to make decisions.\n* Compassion Statements: Expressing sympathy or understanding.\n\n2. MI Non-Adherent Strategies:\n* Unsolicited Suggestions: Offering solutions or actions without the Supporter's prior consent.\n* Direct Disagreement: Explicitly disagreeing, arguing, blaming, criticizing, or questioning the Supporter's honesty.\n * Commands: Issuing orders or imperatives.\n* Cautionary Statements: Warning of potential consequences or serving as a caution.\n\n3. Other Strategies:\n* Open Questions:\n* Personal Disclosure: The supporter shares their own information or experiences.\n* Close-ended Questions: Inquiries answerable with a simple 'yes' or 'no' or a limited set of responses.\n* Open-ended Questions: Questions that allow for a broad range of answers.\n* Repetition/Rephrasing: Echoing, rewording, or paraphrasing the seeker's statements.\n* Enhanced Repetition: Repeating or rephrasing the Supporter's statement with added emphasis or meaning.\n* Educational Feedback: Providing information, feedback, or opinions without giving direct advice.\n\nYour task is to determine the category of the strategy of the Supporter's response.",
