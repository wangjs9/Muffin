            "Supporter: well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged , but thats okay . its not easy , but it is okay , or rather will be okay . experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of . its what gives us depth and character as human beings . ha , well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything , but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days . i slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it .",

            "Seeker: yes , i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of .",
