  "go you! sounds like you've really found some gifts in all this hardship. what are some things that have brought you joy today?",
  "well, i make sure i continue to maintain my relationships as well as possible through the avenues i have available. it is definitely not the same, but it's what we have at the moment.",

  "how are doing?",
  "having many boyfriend is not a big deal",
  "yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen",

  "that said, i am still not totally sure where i am going a quarter of a century in so i am perhaps not the best person to take advice from d",
  "oh no! i can understand why you would be sad.",

  "i'm an older woman, almost 60. i've been married 20 years but i had a lot of boyfriends and i can tell you one thing, if they start to look elsewhere, run for the hills, they will continue to excuse their behavior, apologize, say they will change, and it just gets worse. i drove myself insane with worry, suspicion. i wanted someone to treasure me, not cheat and lie. cheaters don't change their spots.",
  "bye, have a wonderful day.",
  "hello, i just connected. what do you want to talk about most?",
  "you're certainly welcome. take care of yourself!",
  "we are all working towards making ourselves better and i know that you will be successful.",
  "i'm doing great, thank you!",
  "unfortunately there are people out there who are not true friends and who just want something to talk about. i have experienced that myself.",
  "you tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. the ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. that can be exhausting for you. in my past, i had to block someone who did something similar to me. if my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, i asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them too. the people who were closest to me understood what was going on and i realized that people who didnt know me, didnt matter. would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?",
  "i understand people can be cruel and selfish, but not everyone is. some people want to help! life is definitely worth living for.",
  "glad to hear so!",
  "do you have any other worries at this time or want to explore this any further?",
  "in your case, you can control how many applications you fill out. and it sounds like you are filling out many. i believe if you keep doing that, you will find a job.",
  "of course! i got into puzzles.. and games with my little one helped pass the time",
  "i think you need to decide whether you just just let it go or whether you cant'and won't be able to continue the friendship",
  "what is it about work that gets you going?",
  "you are very welcome! i am glad you chatted with me today.",
  "goodnight and good luck.",
  "have you spoken to a professional? is this something that you are able to do through your insurance or work?",
  "have you been feeling this way for a while or is it a surprise change?",
  "i'm sure you'll do your best and pass that exam with flying colors!",
  "it sounds to me like you are willing to do what it takes to be sucsessfull",
  "if he makes that threat again, you might wish to inform him that revenge porn\" is a crime these days. if he knows that you might to go to the authorities, that might get him to leave you alone.",
  "i can see that you are feeling upset and angry when he talks so much and that is totally understandable.",
  "it all comes down to you have to let him see that you can stand on your own. he's treating you like this because he thinks he can control you",
  "i am doing well. thanks for asking. it is really nice outside today.",
  "so from what i understand, you are struggling with study strategies to help you pass your tests?",
  "i totally understand why you are sad. it's very hurtful when someone talks bad about you.",
  "i am good too",
  "i know many people have started adopting animals due to the lockdowns. i don't know if a pet would make you more or less crazy",
  "besides the basic hand washing and hygiene, i don't think we can prepare anymore for it. i think at this point, we will either get it or not until they figure if the vaccine will work or not.",
  "hi, how are you today?",
  "we were supposed to chat for at least 10 messages each i think",
  "well if you can get some concrete info such as from the cdc and john hopkins showing case counts in your area. show them graphs so they can visually see the impact. also if you can get a hold of their doctor yourself, see if you can convince them to give your parents a call, say to check on them and give them some advice.",
  "it was my pleasure.",
  "there should be a website for the local gov't in your city. also: there are ngos that help people in abusive relationships. they can provide counseling and more.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. how can i help?",
  "this is a large cross to bear. so what do you think your next steps are going to be?",
  "you are very welcome! if you ever need anything else, feel free to chat again!",
  "i've also struggled with the same thing. my parents put that pressure on me so i understand that.",
  "i think you should try to talk to them to get to know what is going on. have open communication.",
  "i really like indeed com as well as glassdoor. they give good suggestions and make it easy to apply",
  "i can assume you had been together for awhile",
  "my ex told me i am a partygirl because i drink too much, so i stopped. trying to get him like me more. since then i have not been drinking.",
  "that's a great idea, everyone loves feeding birds! glad we were able to chat.",
  "what kind of hobbies do you have? or are you involved in sports or any type of other activities that you enjoy?",
  "maybe you can do some research on areas and places to move during the holidays. look forward to when you can sit on the beach.",
  "i think that that was bad advice to be honest. i think that you are being ripped off. do not worry, there are things that you can do about it!",
  "hi there, how can i help you this evening?",
  "i found a lot of chat boards and information from a google search. you are not alone and it is ok to feel and to be going through this.",
  "what type of movie were you trying to watch? maybe choose a happier movie than a sad one.",
  "there are companies hiring.",
  "yeah, it took me quite a long time to break it off, and i'm glad i did. i'm glad you decided to call it off with your ex too, it's not an easy decision",
  "you are not alone, a lot of people experience anxiety attacks due to physical stimuli.",
  "that must be very difficult not having your parents to support you and your loved one.",
  "in the past when i have dealt with depression following a breakup i have taken up a new hobby. i found i liked crochet. i made a blanket that i still have today.",
  "it sounds like you're scared of the virus is that right?",
  "no problem! glad i was able to help! is there anything else?",
  "okay. are you excited for the upcoming holidays?",
  "thank you for sharing your feelings with me today.",
  "so he wanted you and made you feel special",
  "i'm glad it was helpful. i wish you luck!",
  "is there anyone in your ihousehold you can confide in with your feelings?",
  "me either, i had never seen a resume with a picture. yes wear a nice suit and look good.",
  "i its been quite tough for us all with the covid 19 chaos",
  "i am well!",
  "i think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly",
  "knowing the severity of the mistake, i think you should tell as good things come to people who are honest : )",
  "not everyone has to go through that, so try to be understanding of yourself.",
  "i understand why that would be so. i have had a similar situation happen to me before.",
  "there are many organizations that can help you get out of an abusive relationship.",
  "if i were you i would call your friend maybe she has some suggestions of things you could do based off of your skills.",
  "watch the brene brown video on youtube with the cartoon animal about empathy - it should help when looking for friends to rely upon",
  "i really understand how you feel. honestly the best thing i did was cool off a little and think how i want to take this friendship forward.",
  "work can often pay for trainings or offer suggestions what may improve work strategies.",
  "love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. you shouldn't blame yourself.",
  "how may i help you today?",
  "so just a week and she is settling in",
  "i think learning a trade would also be a great idea! i would definitely reach out to see where you can start that process.",
  "that sounds great. i find that your mindset is very important, you can only finish great if you feel at ease. why don't you just wait and study on your own first, and officially start when you feel reassured?",
  "that could be fun and validating for you! it's always nice to get some attention",
  "i haven't experienced addictions but i have been supporting my daughter with her addiction for many years, and i have seen how challenging it's been for her.",
  "so you lost your job that is why you are sad right?",
  "you could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. do you have a resume?",
  "i'm good.",
  "i lost my job also because of covid economy inpact",
  "do you feel as though covid is making your situation worse than it would otherwise be?",
  "exactly. let his problems remain his. you worry about you and your daughter and he can watch from a distance confused at his failed attempt to reflect his own dissatisfaction with life onto you didn't work. i think you will feel freed of any stress this has caused.",
  "it sounds like you care more about what others think of you than how you feel about yourself.",
  "are you able to identify any change whatsoever? i ask since any imbalance our body and mind experience is sometimes enough to see a poor reaction, that may lead to things such as migraines",
  "how may i help you today?",
  "i used to have a hard time forming a meaningful relationship but then i realized it's because i had nothing in common with the people i was trying to form them with. once i discovered something i was really drawn to i met people that way like volunteering in my community. have you tried finding people you have more in common with.",
  "it sounds like he is dedicated to his job, which can be a good thing, but i do understand that you want to be put first sometimes as well.",
  "it's understandable for you to feel doubtful. i would give them another chance, suggesting a virtual happy hour and see what they say now hat they no longer have covid excuse",
  "have you spoken to her about how you feel?",
  "you're welcome!",
  "yes we are. would you like to tell me about it?",
  "one thing that worked well for me was speaking to members of the board.",
  "yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. it might be time to end the friendship. i would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. it hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.",
  "you're welcome! if you need any more help just chat back with us again.",
  "we can be our own worst critics, and that's never been truer than when we're facing a challenge. selfdoubt can be such a pain, but when i find i'm having trouble believing in myself and working toward my goals, i'll focus on what i already accomplished, and that helps give me that extra push to keep going",
  "i know how you feel, i have often felt anxiety before a job interview.",
  "oof, i see. i can understand you being upset by that, it's a silly reason to disapprove. was the blowout in any way productive or just angry?",
  "if you have a plan already it will ease some of that anxiety that will come from this tough situation",
  "you should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state. have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord?",
  "i have big shoulders! whats on your mind?",
  "not a problem at all!",
  "but if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? i know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?",
  "yes its good to not dwell on the past like that. have a good day : )",
  "ok, be well.",
  "ah i have done some teaching, it's a very worthy profession.",
  "i see, can you explain what session you skip?",
  "anything else i could help you with?",
  "could i ask if you are currently participating in any activities or diets to manage your weight?",
  "ok thank you i hope things get going in the right direction for you.",
  "i am baking cookies for others, so don't feel sad. maybe i can cheer you up with chocolate chip cookies.",
  "ok i understand now. what was you and this other woman talking about?",
  "seems like she is domineering. tries to disrupt the class environment",
  "yay! a haircut!!! congrats",
  "that can be hard when friends don't reach out despite all your efforts. have you discussed this concern with them?",
  "take care!",
  "are you a veteran? i am happy to help. i am sorry to hear that.",
  "when did this start?",
  "what kind of hobbies do you have?",
  "i don't know if we are supposed to give out private information.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. would you like to tell me more?",
  "you're most welcome and enjoy the rest of your day!",
  "which do you and your man like to communicate?",
  "i feel the same way. i cant wait for life to be normal again. it has been a hard year.",
  "let me ask if you are involved with a church",
  "she and her husband ran the business, but i continued to be burdened with extra responsibility, no extra money or benefits. eventually, the gas station down the hill from us was hiring at a hiring hourly rate than i was receiving from them. i ended up leaving and going back to school.",
  "when you go to bed at night, if you can drift off to dream with a clear conscience, then you're doing significantly better than her!",
  "its a good thing you moved then because at least now you are away from him",
  "i can tell this is challenging for you. may i suggest talking with your professor maybe you could pre record your speech and play it instead of actually doing it? or maybe practicing with some friends or collegues and seeing if they would help you not be so nervous",
  "i'm enjoying hearing the rain on the roof! can i encourage you in some way?",
  "can you tell me some examples about the injustice?",
  "hopefully, you all get to spend so much time togehter.",
  "you're welcome! i am glad that i could help.",
  "of course. do you still experience feelings of sadness when thinking of that time in your life?",
  "not necessarily studying less but break the 6 finals into smaller tasks. use index cards to organize yourself. i alwyas start with an outline of topics i need to cover then put them onto index cards.",
  "yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now.",
  "i found it very useful!",
  "you should give them a call. just out of the blue, nothing commuting. just a casual chat and see if they want to do something. if finding something to do doesn't work out during the call, at least you contacted them and maybe will feel a bit better because you talked to them.",
  "wow, it must be beautiful there! i'm in pennsylvania.",
  "sure no problem. hopefully things will be much better for you soon.",
  "they most likely will, so it is better not to use that chance",
  "i am very sorry to hear that. facing pay cuts at work can be a very stressful situation.",
  "hello",
  "hello there, i am really sorry to hear that. can you give me any more details?",
  "just feel confident that you have fulfilled the assignment according to the guidelines. extra questions from students are wildcards and you can only handle them within the scope of the assignment.",
  "are you planning to get a vaccine and if so do you know how long you have to wait?",
  "hi how are you",
  "if you are interested in religion often times they have local support groups to join as well.",
  "sounds like your support is not appreciated.",
  "what has you worried? i know right now... its a hard time for so many people. i have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks.",
  "yes, i agree. sometimes it just takes time to process all the emotions.",
  "ping : )",
  "im from new york",
  "hello, how are you today?",
  "you can never know people until something happens",
  "yeah... heh i don't go there, being half english and half irish : ). but yeah that was so my era..",
  "when i need to escape intrusive thoughts and rehashing things, i'll put on a podcast. or documentary, or something that's calm, straightforward and factual.",
  "everything going good",
  "i too live in a rural area understand the complexities of tying to find someone. so my next question where looking to find that special connection.",
  "you really should - nobody has the right to dismiss you due to your health problems, that is totally outrageous.",
  "don't think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most.",
  "try to give him more time",
  "i see., yes that could be a risk for sure have you spoken to your manager to see if there may be other opportunities in the manufacturing facility for you? i bet they would rather retrain you for a different position than lose you.",
  "yes i think it will work",
  "does he have any close male friends?",
  "it sounds like your mood has been a challenge for you to complete school.",
  "can you tell me what happened so that i can understand?",
  "i find that sometimes some breathing exercises, getting fresh air, can help clear your head.",
  "yes, i would reach out to old friends who may be willing to give you insight into how they viewed things. support groups can feel intimidating but are usually very welcoming and truly there to help people.",
  "thank you. anything else i could help you with?",
  "it's going to be very painful for a while because you have been invested 3 years in this relationship. do you have friends to talk to that can encourage and support you?",
  "have you contacted your bank yet to see whats going on?",
  "hmm, well maybe take some more lessons, we can always strive to be better at everything we do.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, what about the holidays has you down?",
  "it's really a terrible time. you are definitely not alone in feeling that way. is there something specific going on?",
  "i sincerely hope it is a step toward you regaining your control over how you are able to interact with people. i wish you the best in dealing with this and hope you begin to feel better about it soon, especially entering into a new year!",
  "that's concerning, but very understandable. are you able to financially seek additional help? sometimes it's just what you need, as hard or embarrassing as that may seem. no one needs to know what you seek, but it is important not to disregard additional help, be it mental health, physical therapy, or just general prevention and detection from a pcp.",
  "no need to upset as it part of life. call your best friend and discuss your feeling and i am sure you will feel good.",
  "i see. if it is really likely to happen, i would brush up my resume, make it stand out, but job search can be really stressful.",
  "you are definitely a hard worker and i hope you know that. you make a great employee puttin in som many hours.",
  "yes : )",
  "we all have busy hectic lives at time. true friends make time to be with one another. this world is full of beautiful people to bond with. keeping a closed circle of friends is a blessing.",
  "hopefully, having a new friend who also enjoys sleeping will assist you with this particular disrbance.",
  "have you tried to do some exercise that works dealing with depression",
  "if you need to chat again i would be glad to talk to you, i think you will do great at fixing your rut. thank you.",
  "can you tell me what happened?",
  "nice! it's really fun. i have a few'gigs'i work on but that is my favorite. and thank you about my son. i don't miss school - he's already ready to graduate!",
  "it's very hard to maintain a sense of consistency when we have few boundaries on our time, or a daily routine.",
  "that sounds like a definite winner : ) i see a turner prize beckoning in your future",
  "hi",
  "at least he is trying, as i said before, even with it being so common, it is a mystery to most.",
  "you too always - )",
  "ah yes i know how that feels. has anyone ever taught you any relaxation techniques?",
  "i found a moms group on facebook. they were great to answer pregnancy questions and offer support and suggestions.",
  "hello there",
  "i am not sure what sort of medications they are - are they specifically for insomnia?",
  "well sounds like to me he doesn't know how karma works. lol.. the universe makes ways for us to have what we ask for. a closed door is really rerouting you to where you are suppose to be.",
  "please know that you are not alone in this situation.",
  "okay that is perfectly okay. you are fine. if you need me to assist you in any way just send a question mark.",
  "the thing about aa is everyone in the room will be understanding and nonjudgemental and supportive. and you can learn from them what has worked for them. and it's okay to sit quietly and just listen, you are not forced to participate actively.",
  "hello how are you?",
  "don't be afraid! remember a teacher's job is to teach and help you, she may look a little mean but it doesn't hurt to try and ask, she can't fail you for being confused : )",
  "that's the spirit!",
  "hello, merry christmas eve",
  "if that does not help try to seek help from a marriage counselor i have heard they have saved many marriages from failing",
  "sometimes people just move on from one another. i personally wouldn't try to make these friends see what you are doing. i think you should focus on you, and look to the future.",
  "nice! well, two kids is a lot, especially since they aren't in school yet. you are dealing with the care and growth of the most complex organism on this planet.. times two! that's incredible. first of all, give yourself a pat on the back for that. secondly, is it ok if i ask if you felt guilty for having fun without them? often times guilt robs us of the ability to take care of ourselves, which happens to me all the time.",
  "i used to be a night owl, going to bed early in the morning. i reset my schedule very gradually. i went to bed 15 minutes earlier, and set an alarm for 8 hours later. i did that for 3 days, then i would ratchet it back another 15 minutes. it was a gradual process and the only way i could fix it.",
  "do you have to wait until you get vaccinated to start working on getting a girlfriend?",
  "your welcome have a good night.",
  "that's really hard. but i think you can do it.",
  "awww, thanks. how are things going in your world today?",
  "ok great have a great day",
  "bye!",
  "and yet here we are p. therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, i have found.",
  "and it is important to remember that everyone goes through cycles of feast or famine, and that when you are walking through a famine you yourself are not a failure. as long as you know you are doing your best to succeed under the circumstances you have been handed, you will never truly be a failure to yourself or to others.",
  "i know what it is like to be depressed. i also take medication for this. for solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. have you considered this?",
  "that you have to ask him, tell him to have an honest thought, no judgement, be completely honest with each other",
  "wow that sounds like a big problem. is he aware of how much distress this is causing you?",
  "is it possible that you are overqualified for those positions?",
  "perhaps you should implore the help of somebody else in his life. i understand wanting to help your friend, especially when it's negatively impacting your own mental health, but there's only so much one person can do. you both deserve to be in a good head space and asking for help is okay.",
  "what about family i'm sure they'd love to have you around for christmas",
  "you're welcome!",
  "i actually took a job at walmart just to make ends meet. not the best situation but hey, my family can eat.",
  "have you looked into government assistance due to covid complications?",
  "i am okay. what would you like to talk to me about?",
  "do you think a break would help you feel better able to deal with the demands of her friendship?",
  "please do and remember that they are only there to help you, as i am sure they love you very much.",
  "gardening and horticulture is a great hobby! that definitely could cross over into some of her science classes to make things more interesting and relevant to her.",
  "i can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. has this affected you negatively?",
  "okay, in the mean time follow my advice. it will help.",
  "usually when i find myself going off the deep end, i can reign it back by realizing that the power lies in me. my control to use a relaxer like a cocktail hour, to just be that. it does not have to be a contest. it should make you feel good, then leave it. but if you cannot control it, try and destress another way like baths or massages",
  "don't forget to breathe. exams are stressful but i would suggest don't cram everything to the last minute. usually the hour before the exam, i do something else.",
  "that sounds like a difficult situation. how long has this been going on?",
  "try to talk to him first. before you take them out try to talk to your husband alone, without the presence of your kids. try to see things eye to eye. if he start to yell of curse, you must try to stay calm. be the strong one in the discussion. if things dont work out tell him that you wish to take your kids out for a break.",
  "hell, how can i help?",
  "you have been a good person to take my advices.",
  "of course! i had a good time chatting with you! thank you as well : )",
  "what made you feel this way?",
  "oh no, why do you think she is abusing them?",
  "ok that is one step closer to justice. when is that going to take place, and did you find out if that can be expedited?",
  "i really hope that i have been able to reassure you a little bit and help you to try to think things through. i wish you a very happy holiday season!",
  "well that is good!",
  "i hear you. is there a particular reason why you might feel this way?",
  "hi how are you today? how can i assist you?",
  "youre welcome good luck and i ll say a pray for you",
  "a stimulus check! yes, we can all use money during these trying times.",
  "it isn't anyone's business what you do on your off hours.",

  "awesome! have a wonderful holiday season : )",
  "is she aware that you are a special ed teacher and not a normal teacher",
  "i am so sorry!",
  "that's great. you'll hopefully get at least 2 more normal years to enjoy school. i hope that is reassuring.",
  "i feel you, when everything starts closing down again. i also feel angry because i've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people",
  "research has shown that fear of failure does stem from feelings of anxiety, but is it possible to look at fear of failure from a different perspective?",
  "good also, what would you like to discuss?",
  "like i said, i used to be sad too and not optimistic. but now i am optimistic because i know what it is like to be sad, and i don't want others to feel how i have felt in the past.",
  "thank you and same to you.",
  "it definitely is. i guess thats what makes us human though.",
  "you too",
  "it is great that you can identify what needs to be done in this situation. it sounds like you are ready and willing to seek out help for yourself! do you have access to the resources that are in your area?",
  "accept that you are anxious so you can control it instead of it control you. accepting actually makes you less focused on it, because you don't have to wonder about it.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, i used to have sleeping issues as well. what do you do in the hour leading up to bed time and what do you do in bed before you sleep?",
  "yep, for sure. it's not going to be easy.",
  "i run",
  "very good. i am glad that you have a good family who can support you whenever you need a help.",
  "hello",
  "you will. it will just take some reflection on your part.",
  "why do you think you will lose your job?",
  "this is a hard time of year for many people.",
  "hello, how are you today.",
  "do you have enough money to keep going?",
  "it's great to try to integrate it into your day. all of us tend to have at least a few moments each day to ourselves. even if it's during a shower or bathroom break, you really can meditate anywhere! it's all about being in the here and now.",
  "not a problem, thank you for sharing!",
  "i really hope you'll take the leap to trying rock climbing! it was so fun for me when i did it and i can't wait to get back out there to learn more hopefully covid will be over soon! ) - )",
  "if you are more comfortable texting him then i would suggest doing that but i would not just say nothing about you buying the car you should just let him know.",
  "well, you could read a few books about relationships? do some research",
  "you are more than welcome. i hope you feel a little reassured now.",
  "i am female",

  "oh really? why is that?",
  "i personally like to write out my feelings in a journal and sometimes i listen to music that makes me feel happy. do you have things that you enjoy that you have tried to do?",
  "is there an impending deadline for the project you're worried about meeting? maybe you could contact them through email or another form of outreach.",
  "nobody likes to see that one's friend is sad because of someone else, i think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back",
  "i understand that you are feeling like your professors don't see you as a person with feelings. what happened to make you feel this way?",
  "that was along time. 6 years. was the breakup sudden or had it gradually happened over time",
  "how long have you been feeling this way?",
  "yeah i understand what you're going through. i was in a similar position not too long ago. i had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. how does it make you feel that he's trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours?",
  "did you go your separate ways on good terms?",
  "so you feel that he is misunderstanding life? that he feels that he deserves things just for existing?",
  "ye. you did the right choice. safety is always the first concern",

  "i know that it's really difficult right now, but it seems that the virus is going to get better in the new year. we need to push through these next few months and then it will be over.",
  "okay. one thing-",
  "lol well it's good that you are able to look on the bright side about this. have you considered making plans for the future, once the pandemic is over?",
  "i am sorry to hear that. so, i gather that you and your loved ones are really not getting along right now?",
  "yes, i have. i often look at work assignments as larger than they are and can only get started when i break them down.",
  "it sounds like your daughter does not understand your feelings.",
  "bye",
  "this is very troubling for me to hear! i used to be a cutter as well so i can relate to this 100%",
  "you too!",
  "how can i assist you?",
  "that is a great idea! you are working hard and that hard work is going to pay off! just try to relax and be patient, which can help with your stress.",
  "only you know whether or not if you can look to forgiving and moving forward or if this is such a fundamental break that it is not something you can mend.",
  "oh wow 15 years? i really believe you need a raise and doing more work now.",
  "what led to the breakup?",
  "don't think too much, make yourself busy with other things",
  "you do as well!! i hope you feel better soon!!!!",
  "tension can be high when you already feel stressed about the job situation.",
  "ok. that sounds like something that you should talk to someone about. how many classes are you taking at the moment?",
  "no problem glad that i could uplift someone it lifts me up to help others",
  "i understand better now sorry for the confusion",
  "no, i do not have the premium package",
  "have you tried reading? i find reading motivates me sometimes, too. sometimes too much thinking alone leaves me digging a hole for myself.",
  "if that is all that i can do for you today kindly end and finish. bye, for now and have a great day.",
  "oh okay, have you discussed anything with your friends to see if you find any alternative way of meeting?",
  "i understand that many people now in these days are in a position where he or she needs to be at a location and that is stressfull",
  "i know, it would be nice of her to ask how are you? but maybe she thinks you are a very strong person that does not need help since you do not voice it.?",
  "i understand that completely. it's very helpful to speak with people face to face. however, have you sought other ways, such as through zoom, to interact with peers having the same difficulties?",
  "i can feel your anxiety, and i completely understand why you're feeling that way, but you don't know for sure that will be true. have you started looking for a new job already?",
  "oh that's a shame. have you tried, for instance, getting some exercise an hour or two before bed?",
  "yeah, a way to make the best of it.",
  "well i am happy to listen to any problems that you have",
  "exactly, volunteering is a great option. and there are many organizations to join.",
  "why do you feel you can't tell them?",
  "okay, well, firstly i think it's a good idea to try to stay calm and not let yourself be overwhelmed. is it possible to get any sort of tuition to prepare for the exam?",
  "yes, can you try organizing a virtual get together?",
  "this might sound silly, but reddit is a great resource. there are some great support groups there who help each other and lift people up",
  "are they normally understanding of things like this? do you have a good boss?",
  "hello. i totally understand being stressed out by school. i am currently in a ph d. program and it can be overwhelming. do you have any hobbies to help with your stress?",
  "just from this short conversation, i can tell how upset you are. it's definitely hard this year since people aren't traveling.",
  "don't worry about it just lighting the mood but really girls can be complicated and i get that its hard to understand why she left",
  "it sounds like you are frustrated. do you mind sharing what the fight was about?",
  "it can be stressful but a positive stress. remember you are researching how to help yourself and feel better!",
  "why do you think this would be an issue?",
  "hi larry. what sort of job do you do?",
  "well, i believe that there are some new advances in migraine treatment at the moment so i think things will improve for you. i am sorry if i am not being more help.",
  "trust is tricky. do you know brene brown? the researcher, author, ted talk researcher?",
  "that can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year",
  "sounds good. i am glad that you trust me. what did the strange machine do?",
  "is there anything else that i can help you with today?",
  "that's great to hear! my suggestion is to always think positively. you can do this!",
  "i understand your concern there but it could help pay some as to help you not to get to far behind until you find something.",
  "is it for work or for school?",
  "it just worries me that he might treat you the same way if you were ever in the same position",
  "have you tried reaching out a company hotline or maybe an hr department in your company to speak about this issue anonously this could help with the tension between you and your boss",
  "taking a social media and news break could be a good idea. sometimes it gets to feeling like we have to keep reading about the horrors of the world or else we are not doing anything at all.",
  "just from talking to you i can see that it was very stressing for you",
  "or laughter programs",
  "try to take comfort in the fact that she was your go to, she was there for you but she was also trying to make you a better person.",
  "vitamin d d is over the counter! any pharmacy, amazon, its easy to find and cheap",
  "you're welcome, have a lovely day",
  "yes it is. they help you learn to trust again if that's what you want. would you like the web address?",
  "have fun : )",
  "i can relate to that. maybe you can start with journaling and writing out your feelings and thoughts. they may help clear your mind especially in the evenings.",
  "that is difficult. i understand how it feels to be lonely. something ive done when ive felt that way was to learn to fall in love with myself. i like to do self care and make time for things i might not have time for if i were in a relationship.",
  "do you have any hobbies? i found that refocusing my energy into something i love doing really helped to bring my mood up.",
  "i can understand that.",
  "have you thought of any possible solutions you think could possibly work to fix this issue?",
  "i bet you are handsome! don't let it get to you.",
  "sounds like you are depressed? well i can assure you that i am here if you need or want to talk about why your depressed.",
  "sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended. and, it can help preserve your sense of being grounded.",
  "i'm sure you are busy, but realize, your emotional health is important too and we always need to make time to connect with people.",
  "you can terminate the convo at any time!",
  "that makes sense. how long were you guys together?",
  "what's on your mind?",
  "make a fresh start again",
  "that's a tough one. i personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. i have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. the biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don't read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep.",
  "it will take time, the best way to let it not control you is by talking about it. you gain control over it that way.",
  "i am really sorry. is she able to get any other sort of work, even if it's less well paid?",
  "hello doing good",
  "do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something?",
  "what was it about your situation that was so bad? did you lose your job? why are you so stressed? lack of financs. depresseions because of lack of job finances etc... lover?",
  "sometimes you don't like the activities they do? have you thought of any ways you might be able to get them to do activities you do like?",
  "you should be understanding, especially since you already know this.",
  "whichever you enjoy.. pick one. there are a lots of online resources you cloud use.",
  "yes! although i probably couldnt walk nor run 5 miles a day. i love getting out to enjoy nature. it always helps to keep mind off things. does that usually work for you?",
  "have you try looking another job from nearby",
  "it's good for you to do that. you'll feel better with time.",
  "yes maybe that will work for them and probably want to be outside",
  "that's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much. as much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too. it's like when you're on a plane and the safety pamphlet tells you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. you might not be able to help your cousin as much as you want to if you are suffering too much. are there any mental health resources you've tried for yourself other than reaching out here?",
  "it is easy to lose patience when the blame is always directed towards you. i am sorry that is occurring, but applaud you for your efforts in trying to express your frustration.",
  "ok, i understand.",
  "a group is an excellent idea!",
  "bye, have a great day",
  "how is life treating you otherwise?",
  "pets are great like that. do you perhaps have a neighbour whose dog you could walk if you can't get one of your own?",
  "i think starting with the school counselor is a great idea, i feel she will have more of an idea of how your son functions in school and maybe give ideas to helping his mood.",
  "that is not good. is this a new thing or has it always been this way?",
  "you can always share and contact me if you need any help. i will be happy to help. take care.",
  "i'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma mental and physical ) to begin with and the support is much needed.",
  "it sounds to me like you're thinking that you've disappointed your parents by falling behind in class a little?",
  "was it a common thing that he didn't give you the attention you wanted?",
  "thank you for sharing with me, and i truly hope that it has helped you even just a little.",
  "do you feel that this has knocked your self confidence and affected your family life at all?",
  "not having a job can feel overwhelming, especially on top of this pandemic.",
  "it sounds like you feel your friends are too busy for you.",
  "i have not but i know people who are in your situation.",
  "i see and there was a time i felt lost or not needed too. what is it you would like to do with your life?",
  "why you are lost a job?",
  "maybe you can develop your own courses? or, you can also become an online trainer for a variety of organizations. since many companies are transitioning to a work from home environment, this is a great time to offer your training services to various companies.",
  "whenever i have a large project and lose motivation, i set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. for example, i will make sure i work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, i generate ideas to keep me on track.",
  "i have had a friend not to trust me and i know how hurtful that can feel, maybe there has just been some sort of misunderstanding.",
  "it seems like you really do have a lot on your plate. do you have any other family members who can help with your duties? older children, a spouse or parents nearby?",

  "yes, pulling through this is the most important, because there may be a better future waiting ahead of you",
  "you as well",
  "it sounds like the stress of the unknown is really getting to you. i have definitely felt this way over the past year too, you aren't alone. when i start to fell stressed, i take a few deep breaths and focus on what i can control.",
  "if you want to maintain relationships, then you woudl have further converstations, but if you are ready to move on, nothing they can say will change what you need to do - move on",
  "if you try to get into a new relationship with the mentality that woment cant be trusted.... what re the chances you open up and let the next girl get to know you?",
  "time management can be very difficult with a normal class load, that sounds exhausting.",
  "if you need permission, i hereby grant you permission to pursue what is meaningful to you.",
  "have a great night and take care of yourself. it has been a pleasure.",
  "oh wow that would make things complicated! but yes the deep breathing would definitely help, i'm sure!",
  "i can relate. this whole year has been a mess.",
  "good thank you",
  "well... to be honest it doesn't sound very terrible. most children that age do things like that ; )",
  "unfortunately, most places of employment take advantage of their good workers cause they feel they can get away with it and they will leave. but, at the end of the day, your well being is important.",

  "you haven't done anything wrong. i have felt that way at work before too. i went to therapy to deal with my difficult work situation.",
  "well, they most likely do it over zoom. but it's better because it's one on one",
  "maybe next year will be a better year",
  "you don't think others",
  "i can imagine that's difficult, that would be a lot of close time together.",
  "i can definitely understand that. i remember feeling a certain way when i pursued another degree. what would make you feel a bit more confident about the idea of school?",
  "do you need any more advice on this matter or do you have any other concerns? the bully is the problem, not you. do you have anyone who can stand up to them with you for support?",
  "does your class have a study group?",
  "is there anything else you would like to talk about?",
  "i'm really sorry to hear that.",
  "hmm, it sounds like she isn't being completely honest with you.",
  "that was a big shock, i was in relationship for 3 years",
  "is there anything you'd like to talk to me about?",
  "not really. what i do is record the video beforehand, and then upload it.",
  "ok sounds good",
  "that's great to hear, i'm glad we were able to chat!",
  "it was nice chatting with you as well. take care and stay safe",
  "the pandemic situation is tough for everyone, so don't worry",

  "that is really relatable. i can understand how scary it is for you, especially with your husband's pay cut.",
  "it sounds like you are unsure of how to deal with favoritism in the workplace. i have dealt with similar situations.",

  "can you tell me a little more about your situation so i can better understand?",
  "uh, oh, how do you think she will react?",

  "hi! how are you today?",
  "merry christmas and happy new year.",
  "i think that either way you choose to proceed there is always the choice of remaining amicable. you're all adults, so sitting down and discussing what comes next is an inevitability. maybe they will choose to leave, or you'll decide it would be better for you to go, but at least the discussion would be ongoing to perhaps resume the friendship at a later time?",
  "yes, it will be hard at first because you are not use to it, but once you get started your life will be so much more relaxing. your stress level will become more less than what is was before. also, you will be able to have a clearer mind to concentrate on your schoolwork more by having this new schedule.",

  "you could also reduce fear by considering door dash and other food delivery services.",
  "have you tried to talk to your husband about your feelings and how you might not be willing to accept this?",
  "that's insane! i did chem and bio one semester at the same time - with 8 hours of labs a week - i quickly changed majors. i respect what you're doing!",

  "you need to indulge yourself from time to time : ) get yourself a nice bottle of wine too. though maybe not chocolate d",
  "i'm sure it will be. definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the mturk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills.",

  "i understand that feeling! well hopefully we get paid; ) keep your head up: ) good luck to you!",
  "i make a good case right so you might think i was but no, i am not i only wish to be. i wish to be much more than i am but ya know i work with what i can find to do. id savd the world every day if zi could knowing my efforts were toowrads a good cause.",

  "i'm glad i can help! is there anything else you would like to talk about>",
  "is it possible that you are worrying unnecessarily though?",
  "i think that that would be a good idea! for info, in terms of how long it takes to get over it. i have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it. personally i think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup.",
  "oh i see i'm so sorry to hear that. have you tried doing other activities to make your mind off it?",
  "breakups can be really hard!",
  "this happens very common in friend groups. it is understandable that you feel upset",
  "usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. it tends to be the easier option.",
  "i can tell you from personal experience that loose skin, stretch marks, and loosening of other parts\" do all self correct with time. you will feel better about your body again when they do.",
  "i see you are looking for some resources on a course that your professor isn't helping you with. what kind of questions do you have?",
  "are you starting to feel better about the situation?",
  "i have also been worried recently about finding another job because of the pandemic, but i found that getting back into my hobbies has helped keep me distracted and get my mind off of it.",
  "does your husband realize that the other child notices it and how it hurts them?",
  "hi, how are you feeling right now?",
  "of course! and it wouldn't be fair to her, just as much as it wouldn't be fair to you. your happiness is just as important!",
  "since covid time. after covid than you can go out with friends go see a movie you wanted to see maybe or go get your hair nail done.. what do you like to do just for fun",
  "then it must be good advice lol",
  "don't ever think you are a bother to anyone. you are loved by those close to you and i am sure they would be great comfort during this.",
  "i have to finish my book today for my book club : )",
  "what is unit? are talking school",
  "special talents to showcase",

  "you've done great at telling me your thoughts and deep feelings.",
  "i know, this year was stressful for everyone in our planet, so you are not alone",
  "i'm sure that you wouldn't annoy them. it's their job to talk to their employees.",
  "i can agree with that! my children seems to always be needing something. it can sometimes feel overwhelming.",
  "you are welcome",
  "and a place to vent.",
  "yes i think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! it definitely helps. you are welcome! : )",
  "that sounds reasonable to me. and if they try to make you feel guilty, reject that. tell them, i'm sorry, but i feel this is reasonable, and truly it is.",
  "oh no and how did this make you feel?",
  "well, perhaps they can at least alleviate your anxiety somewhat. or maybe even get you a sick note to give you a little extra time to complete your assignment s",
  "have you tried talking to your husband about your feelings, and how it is affecting your day today life?",
  "you're welcome!",
  "yeah, everyone including me, forgets that each individual has their own sets of things going on each day. always good to look at it through their eyes a bit.",
  "that is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming.",
  "do you want to talk about whats going on right now?",
  "yes! not a whole lot honestly, but i like it.",
  "what are your objections against a private person? is it that you feel you could not trust them? do you have any family members who could help?",
  "is that the kind of job that you can do from home?",
  "i think these situations cause us to take care of our selves first, like you are doing by wearing your mask and still loving your friend maybe from afar ). your idea of separation is wise, unless you want to protect your relationship with her and let her be.",
  "do you want to improve for her? or for yourself do you think?",
  "i'm sorry, what type of problems are you having?",
  "i know it's very tough for you, can you stay away from your partner/ people around you for the time being?",
  "i worked for a boss who gave me a chance when i was rather unhirable. i worked there for three years, but i was burning out hardcore. she was kind but she paid me much less than a normal professional would in that position, and took advantage of me.",
  "have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts?",
  "tell her to meditation or yoga in the morning. this will definitely helped and her mind will be busy",
  "he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly",
  "i am great. i love the outdoors it make you feel free and apart of something much larger than yourself.",
  "well what's going on with your work? what's causing so much pressure in your life?",
  "after interviewing with a company are you following up on a timeline or a decision? companies like to see initiative in their potential hires after an interview.",
  "oh no, are you doing remote teaching now?",
  "that's very kind of you to say, thank you - )",
  "if your manager has a supervisor that you feel would not approve of this behavior, i would speak to them. if you don't feel that would be beneficial to you, you could reach out to your company hr department.",
  "i think that most people understand that there are many people in a huge crunch right now. i don't see that it woudl hurt to talk to them and be honest",
  "i wish you all the very best for 2021. i hope that you get to get together with your band again and rock!",
  "is there anything else i can help you with today?",
  "it seems, you are feeling so bad about his situation, and worried of his health",
  "oh! did you try to make friendship with him?",
  "i'm certainly glad your uncle is there to talk to. i know family can be a source of strength. have you been able to find any assistance from local organizations?",
  "if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak",
  "i know how that feels. it's really hard at first, but it gets easier. there are some benefits to being single after all.",
  "i'm so sorry to hear that. breakups are never an easy thing. i've also gone through those and they can make you feel awful.",
  "it is bad but recoverable. alot of coughing and alot of sleeping. high fever. but a family member of mine who is 74 caught it. he has diabetes obese and has heart trouble. he made a full recovery with no issues",

  "good",
  "that is really unfair and hard to deal with are you close to any famliy?",
  "i feel obligated to help during christmas because i had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts.",
  "do u have any friends that are still talking to you?",
  "in apartment you house plants are great option. i love walking to. it is a great stress reliever.",
  "i'm sure you will find something very quickly.",
  "ok, that is a bit of relief",
  "you too!",
  "there are substantially more people recovering from covid each day despite the number of infected growing exponentially. i am sure that, with the proper care, your mother in law will make it, and so will your husband.",
  "it sounds like you feel you are not heard and thats why you are pushing yourself hard do you feel that way",
  "unfortunately, this is such an isolating time and losing some of that contact is going to be an adjustment. i can completely understand that.",
  "does your specialist know you are this down?",
  "yeah, covid19 is a real bummer but i am sure we will soon get over it and the economy will bounce back",
  "have you looked into hiring agencies to help you find a more permanent job during the pandemic? hiring agencies are a great resource to find a job that fist you best.",

  "are you considering switching jobs?",
  "also, there are many online resources that are great at finding available jobs and require your time and effort, but not any money invested. this might be a good tool as well!",
  "i am from upstate new york and it can get nasty when it comes across the lakes",
  "how are your boys feeling about it?",
  "can you talk about your feelings at this time",
  "yes it is nice. are you doing anything festive today?",

  "don't worry about my day, i'm 34 and retired i do this to help people, tell me about your situation.",
  "you are very weclome, goodbye",
  "you are very welcome!",
  "doesn't hurt to check them out.",
  "i looks like you have hard time in sleeping. correct me if i am wrong.",
  "so, why do you think they think that?",
  "what was happening in your life that made you lose interest?",
  "ah i hear you on that. do you feel that this is related to the pandemic or is it something that has been ongoing for a while?",

  "i used to do a hour at a time; maybe one or twice a week.",
  "you can tell me what's bothering you",
  "there are a numerous companies that need call center help",
  "perhaps you could suggest him taking some deep breaths to calm down.",
  "church is always a great idea. i think church would be very helpful. maybe someday you should even consider going to a predominantly black church.",
  "that makes it hard when you have already tried to take the steps to help you improve the situation. if i may offer a suggestion, perhaps you should approach him, and advise him you are not interested in arguing since that won't improve the situation, but be upfront and honest about how this is making you feel, and how his lack of support will ultimately harm the whole family. and also maybe ask him if there is anything going on with him to find out why his support to you, and the children has changed.",
  "so, the question is... how do you deal in the short term?",
  "okay, thank you for clarifying - ) your frustration is understandable. having a job while being in school can be tough, that is true. however if you are discerning you could get a job that would have flexible hours, especially if you let them know beforehand that you're planning on getting back into school as soon as possible.",
  "well i dont know when this is going to end but if we let this isolation win the we are going to get worse. so i would recommend to share time with your love one and clear your mind and take out all the negative things away. right now im talking a lot with my brother and me and him never get along. so this is a huge step",
  "i need it and it really does help ease the stress for me",
  "you as well!",
  "that's really hard, have you spoken to any of your coworkers",
  "please can i ask you why she is doing this?",
  "i think you know yourself better than anyone else and are about to leap in to a new chapter of your life. you received lessons from both the past relationships and can take that forward knowing what you wish for and deserve.",
  "i have to say it's hard to find motivation and i was in that spot at the beginning. with news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat. are you able to hang out with friends?",
  "that sounds like a challenging situation. how long have you had to deal with this?",
  "this pandemic most definitely has caused frustrations for everyone",
  "welp, thanks for the conversation, i hope i helped. cuddle the cat, enjoy the beach, and remember this is all temporary!",
  "have you talked to someone about this?",
  "what would help you feel better about the situation? what are you doing to pass the time?",
  "unfortunately this may be upsetting in the short term. i had a friend who had a similar issue. he wanted to end things with his girlfriend and they ended up having an honest conversation, which was upsetting at the time but they are still friends to this day and parted on good terms.",
  "she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her ted talk and there's a great youtube video on empathy",
  "we thankfully have not got on lockdown just yet, but i know it will be happening soon. we live in a very small town and it has got bad here that either we know someone who has it, or someone in the family has it. it seemed like it just happened over night that it just spread so fast here that everyone is in a panic mode again. what type of things do you do while you are on lockdown?",
  "it can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. has anyone every discussed an intervention?",
  "i am sorry to hear that, people are very quick to judge so it's very unfortunate that you were treated that way.",
  "i have suffered from depression for many years so i can totally empathise with you.",
  "ok clarify your friendship value",
  "that sounds really tough. sometimes people who are in your situation find it comforting to talk to someone they are close with. what do you think about this?",
  "oh sorry for misunderstanding you",
  "kinda ok, but struggling with some issues such as eating unhealthy",
  "yeah even i can see that when i see my daughters class. it is a bad situation all around. the thing is though you cant focus on that or it will bleed out into your job. you have to try to stay positive and promote positivity even with how hard it can be.",
  "i think with that kind of connection with your boss especially with your job loss being circumstantial you should have a really good starting point",
  "sounds like you are pretty depressed. that is understandable though",
  "hi, how can i help you?",
  "hello there. how are you feeling today?",
  "but of course!",
  "that's an understandable fear.",
  "goodbye. have a good night. i hope you feel better.",
  "some people can't do what you do because they don't have the heart to give someone else bad news. the reality is though, someone needs to fill that role and you do help people",
  "can you tell me more about how you're feeling now?",
  "i can feel how anxious you are about the situation.",
  "i see, that is a problem.",
  "how is your daughter doing now?",
  "digital contact does have its limitations. could you meet with people outside at a distance?",
  "have you tried hanging a large calendar and writing down his schedule as well as any plans you made? then each morning, do a quick 1minute check on the calendar to ensure you are both on the same page.",
  "well, if it is affecting your grades and the rest of your real life then it might be. and it's best to catch these things before they get worse.",
  "are you wanting to get back to work?",
  "my husband just got me a daytimer, and i write my goals in that for the new year, and i try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can't get stuck in them.",
  "i glad that you were able to talk about how you are feeling. that is a big step in feeling better",
  "that is good, you can have soft copies on your phone, open it anytime your are bored",
  "i agree, there is so much going on that it is hard to stay focused while trying to make sense of all this",
  "how does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him?",
  "no you should not have to feel you made a mistake for the time you are taking out of work for a necessity.",
  "it sounds like you are wanting to tell your boss about this. how do you imagine you will go about telling your boss?",
  "maybe you should do more of that, it sounds like a good idea? don't feel guilty for doing so either as it acts as a'medicine '. if the'medicine'works then take it",
  "how long have you been in a relationship with your man?",
  "it can be really hard to do, talking to them but i believe in you, you can do it!",
  "oh! that's very sad but try to move out from this",
  "sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start!",
  "i am going for a walk later.. i live in ontario canada... it's a bit cool and windy today but i try to get out every day",
  "can you see any way in which you can work around it and be friends again?",
  "it seems you are a bit low on selfconfidence. i have been there too. if i may ask you, does this feeling persist all the time irrespective of the situation or it happens after any particular event - say a test or some outdoor game for example?",
  "great!! have a great day.",
  "that is a very hard thing to be going through where you very close to your cat?",
  "i would seek the advice of a lawyer. i'm sorry this has happened thats horrible.",
  "that sounds like a great plan. you sound like a very motivated person getting a masters degree is so difficult and you are working toward it. you will do well. i wish you all the best.",
  "journaling your feelings has also been an effective way to get the emotions out! you seem like you have a lot to share so it might be a good option for you!",
  "hi how are you doing today?",
  "are his tempers basically towards you because you are full time",
  "i'm sorry to hear that. what is causing you these feelings?",
  "they are fun to have lol, now that is the spirit go to the shelter and safe one of those poor souls. and you can pet it and it is happy to see you any time,",
  "thats wonderful, i am closer to my spouse now also.",
  "if i am understanding you correctly, you feel your mom may not be able to sustain herself during her time of recovery, is that correct?",
  "i've always wanted to go to las vegas. my brother and his girlfriend just took a trip out there not too long ago.",
  "oh, wow! that is really traumatic and i cant imagine that happening to me. you have been through a lot of pain and suffering. i am so sorry.",
  "take care nicholas! you as well.",
  "from my experience it has helped tremendously to take a few deep breaths",
  "oh, i understand being nervous about covid exposure, especially if you're working with the public, who may not abide by mask mandates and social distancing. is there anything you can do to limit exposure?",
  "i can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that's bothering you?",
  "awesome and good night",
  "try to read something boring novel it will help you in sleep",
  "i am glad to hear you are feeling a little better! yes, bad management is so toxic. even with great coworkers in a job you love, horrible management can ruin it quickly.",
  "of course! what sort of issue is it?",
  "oh i see. apart from isolating how is he doing otherwise, like at school? is he still seeing his friends at all?",
  "i am nervous in situations that are new to me as well so i understand this. is there something you can do to get past this nervousness so that you fel comfortable seeking out this help?",
  "what else can i help you with?",
  "take those tools you have, steer clear of her and do your own thing!",
  "doing that definitely helped me too!",
  "just from chatting with you, i can feel how anxious you are.",
  "yes, there is a lag in the system. it takes a while for the response to upload",
  "it sounds like you don't feel like going out?",
  "my friend swears by st johns wort. its some herb that is a natural anti depressant. you could do some research and see!",
  "that is horrible. do you mind if i ask why?",
  "as we were told growing up the worst they could say is no,",
  "it sounds like you are really stressed over the breakup and you want to know how to move forward",
  "well, i don't know if you are being serious or not but i'm going to reach out to mturk and get them to get help for you. i don't mess around with this stuff.",
  "i am so sorry to hear that. sounds like your girlfriend and her grandmother could use some time away from her grandfather.",
  "thanks for sharing with me. take care now.",
  "and i am glad you are someone easy to talk to! some of my patients do not argument at all and expect me to end the conversation when i, as a therapist, have to make sure they are good to go! helping you has been a pleasure!",
  "sometimes people also grow and change so relationships evolve as well. is there something you would hope to gain from the friendship that you think could change?",
  "is this your first holiday alone?",
  "one thing i would suggest is after writing everything down that you rehearse it for a while in front of a mirror and picture that you are talking to your husband while you are doing this.",
  "no problem that is what i am here for",
  "i make a list of the things i can do - and the things i can't. then you can have goals. and if you can work on a goal, for example, if you need to write a resume, you start working on that a little bit every day until it's done. but if there is nothing you can do about the situation, you have to pray to god to help you then let it go. if you can not fix it now, you will only make yourself sick thinking about it.",
  "i too worry about things i feel i cannot control, the lack of sleep due to this just makes it worse so i try to think of positive things, but its hard.",
  "that helps me balance things out in my head sometimes. sometimes we get stuck. it happens.",
  "i hope our chat has helped you out a bit. maybe even given you some things to reflect on. you always have the power to change the dynamic of the situation. remember that.",
  "or maybe they dont want to see thire kid grow up that fast your are almost 18!"
