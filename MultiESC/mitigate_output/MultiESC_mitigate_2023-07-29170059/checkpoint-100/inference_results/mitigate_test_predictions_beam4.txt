i can understand how you feel, covid - 19 is making you feel like you are not making enough money.
i am sorry to hear that. i am sure that they are trying to shame you for donating too much to charity.
i am sorry to hear that. if you don't want to hurt someone then you should not be friends with them at all.
i am sorry to hear that. i have also been in financial trouble in the past so i know how difficult it can be.
you can donate to the non - profit if you don't feel like you are being honest with them about your situation.

that's a great idea. i think you should give her a chance and see if she still doesn't like the relationship. it's always worth talking to someone who is older than you.
yes, i have had to deal with that as well. it's very difficult to be in a relationship with someone who is younger than you.
do you think it might be worth talking to her about it before you approach her?
i think it's worth talking to her about it and asking her if she's still interested in your friendship.

i think it would be better to just let them know you are still free and really want to spend time with your friends.

i would say to her that you are trying to help her and that you want her to understand that you feel betrayed and nothurt.
i think it is a good idea to let her come to you when she is ready.

i am sorry to hear that. i have been in the same situation myself and it's been very difficult to come off it.
i am in the uk so i have no idea where you are coming from.
i am not anti - khan at all but i don't feel like i can vote in london either.
i am not anti - khan at all. i just don't want to be in a city where there's no surrender.
i used to smoke a lot of weed when i was in university too. i was very into it. i used to be very anti - khan too.
i'm sorry to hear that. i used to be a student at london and i didn't pay much attention to the politics at all.
i've been in a lot of drug shops in the uk : )
i've been in drug shops before, but i've never been to one. i don't have any friends or family there.
that's true. i've been in the same boat a few times.
that's a shame. i don't think it's legal for derry people to be referred to as derry girls.
i'm glad to hear that : )
you too : )

i am so sorry to hear that. can you please tell me more about the situation?
it sounds like you have lost your job due to covid - 19 lockdowns.
that is a long time to be out of a job, i have been in accounting for 5 years.
i understand, i have been in a similar situation. have you spoken to your wife about it?
i'm sure she will be very upset about it. is there anything else i can help you with?
i understand, i have been in the same situation and i know how difficult it can be.
i think you should tell her that you have a resume and a cpa and that you want to be in accounting.
i think that is a great idea. i think it is a good idea to take some time away from everything. maybe tell your wife that you are looking for a new job and that you will be able to find one soon.
i understand that, i am sure you can figure out a way to get out of this.
i understand that. i have been in a similar situation and i know how hard it can be.

i can understand how you feel. i have been in a similar situation.
i can see how that would make you feel. do you think you deserve better than what he was treating you?
i'm sorry to hear that. i've been in that position myself.
it sounds like you are going through a tough time right now. i think you are doing the right thing. do you have any friends or family that you can talk to?
i've been there too. i've had my fair share of drama and i'm sure you will find someone deserving of your time. it's not worth it in the long run.
i think you need to learn from the past and not let the past repeat itself.
i'm sorry to hear that! i hope you can find someone who will love you and give you time to yourself!
i think you're doing the right thing! you can get a new haircut! it will make you feel like you have invested a lot in yourself!
i'm sure you will find someone who will be jealous of you and see you happy!
i'm so sorry to hear that. have you been able to talk to him about this?
i'm so sorry to hear that. i've been in a similar situation before.

i'm 25, so i am not sure if you have been in love with someone before or not.

i'm sorry to hear that. i've been in a similar situation myself and i know how lonely it can feel.
i can understand how that would make you feel. do you have any friends or family that you could talk to?

i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything specific that you'd like to talk about?
i'm sorry to hear that. i've been in that position too..
if you're not able to find a job due to the pandemic, it's a good time to start looking for a new hobby..
i think you're doing the right thing. i know it's hard to keep your mind off of the pandemic, but i think you can do it!
that's great! it's hard to keep track of what's going on, but you're doing the right thing..
that's understandable. it's hard to find a purpose when you're in your 30s..

it is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies.

i think that you should be able to tell him straight out what you are feeling..
i think it would be a good idea to move on from this.
i think that there are a lot of benefits to it.
i think that it is a good thing to be able to move on from this. it gives you more clout.
