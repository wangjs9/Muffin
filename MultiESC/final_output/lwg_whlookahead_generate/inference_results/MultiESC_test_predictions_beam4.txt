i'm so sorry to hear that. i'm glad that you are able to meet up with people who are close to you and share a lot of interests with you. do you have any family members that you can confide in?
i think that's a really important thing to do. i think it's important to be able to connect with people in your town! people close by!
i think it's a great idea to take the time to actually meet people in person first. you can learn how to interact with people online first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up with them in person. that way you won't have to worry about being awkward.

i think you should talk to her about it. i don't think that's the best thing to do. i think talking to her should be the first step in addressing your suspicions.
i'm glad i could be of some help. i wish you the best of luck in the future.

i understand how you feel. i would suggest talking to her about your feelings and how you want to move forward but with her you feel sad.
i think you should talk to her about it and see if she is willing to listen to you. i think it would be best to let her know that you are a grown woman and that you want to go far and grow more.
i think it's important to give her a chance and ask if she's listening to you and if she is not listening to her, then you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is worth it.
i'm sorry to hear that. i think it's a good idea to give her a chance and see if she's willing to listen to you.
i think it's best to give her a chance and ask her if she really wants to be with you. if she doesn't want to talk about it then maybe you should try to talk to her about it and see if she's receptive to your suggestions.
that's a very difficult situation to be in. do you think it might help to talk to her about it before you end it?
i think it would be a good idea to give her a chance and see if she will accept you as you are.

hello, how are you today?
i see you are having low mood and general depression. can you tell me more about it?
i can understand how you are feeling. have you tried any coping mechanisms to help you get over it?
i'm sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to your doctor about it?
ok so you worry that you will not be able to get out of bed because of the intensity of your feelings?
i would suggest taking a deep breath and trying to think of the good in your situation.
i think that recognising the problem is the first step in recognising it and recognising that it is a problem.
i understand why you would want to talk to people about it. it's a shame that you don't want to share your problems with anyone.
i think it would be a great idea to reach out to people who care about you and listen to how you are feeling.
i think it is good that you are willing to give it a go.
i think that it would be better to get in touch with your doctor and see if they are able to help you.

i think you are doing the right thing by arranging a time to spend with your daughter and spending time with him.
hello, how are you doing today?
i'm sorry to hear that. it sounds like you are nervous about the future. is that correct?
i've lost my job too, but i didn't lose my job because of covid.
that's a great idea. i had a lot of anxiety about losing my job too.
yes, i use a lot of tools to help me get through this. i have been on unemployment for a while, and i had some savings.
well, i think it might be helpful to take some deep breaths and try to focus on your sleep. it's important to remember that you are not alone in this, and if you're not able to sleep, there are a lot of resources out there that you could use.
i've taken melatonin before, but it's not much of an antidepressant.
i am glad i was able to be of some help to you. i wish you all the best in the future.

i understand. it sounds like you are trying to help your friend and not betray her. is that correct?
i would say to her that you are trying to help her and that you feel betrayed because she did not want to help you.

oh no, i am sorry to hear that. do you have any friends that you can talk to about this?
i think that the best thing you can do is move on and move on from this. it's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way.
i think it's important to remember that you are still there, you just don't forget about him.
i think that's completely normal and you shouldn't feel guilty for it.
i don't think you should feel guilty for not telling him how you feel.
i think it would have been easier to deal with if he had retired and not had to spend so much time taking care of you.
i'm glad to hear that. i wish you the best of luck.

i am in the uk. i can't wait for the elections to be over.
i don't think you are anti - khan at all. it's just a question of how do you feel about it?
i've been anti - khan too. i don't think it's a good idea to give up on the idea of democracy. i'm not sure what the future holds for us, but i think we'll get through this!
i used to be anti - khan too but i've since moved on to something else : d. i don't think it's any more important now than it was when i was in college.
i've been in that position too. it's a terrible time of year to be in this position.
i'm sorry to hear that. i used to be a student in the uk and i had a lot of problems with synthetics.

that's a tough situation to be in, but i think you are doing the right thing.
that is a long time to be in a situation like that.
i am sorry to hear that, i have been in the same situation myself.
yes, i think you should tell your wife. she might not be too keen on the news.
i understand, i think it's a sad time for all of us. i have been in the accounting business for 5 years and i know how hard it is.
i think you should tell your wife that you are a good accountant and that you have a good resume.
i'm sure that is a tough situation to be in.
i understand how you feel, but i think you should tell your wife that you are spending a lot of money on lotto and that you don't deserve to be out of a job.
i understand how you feel. maybe tell your wife that you are sad and want to move on from this.
i'm sure that's true, i've been in that position myself. i know how hard it can be, but i think you can do it.

i'm sorry to hear that. i've been there too. i think it's important to let your feelings get the best of you. do you want to be with someone else?
i can see how that would make you feel. do you have any friends or family that you can talk to about this?
i'm sorry to hear that. i've been there too.
i think the best thing you can do is take one step at a time and learn from your mistakes.
do you have any hobbies that you enjoy doing?
i think getting a new haircut is a great idea!
i think the best revenge is moving on and looking good and with somebody hot!
i'm so sorry to hear that. i have been in a similar situation.

i'm sorry to hear that. i totally understand how you feel. i've been on scholarship for two years and i know how hard it can be to keep above a 3. 0 gpa.
that's completely understandable, i've also struggled with learning from home in the past.

yes, i'm a student too so i understand how you feel.

i suggest that you try to get your mind off of her and move on with your life.
i think that you should move on from this situation and start looking for new opportunities.
you're welcome! i am sure there are plenty of people out there that are compatible with you.
