      "Seeker: Well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do\n",
      "Supporter: I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?\n",
      "Seeker: Yes. I am a college student and I live on campus. The day before I moved in my dad said some unforgivable things to me and we haven't spoke since\n",
      "Seeker: I have no choice but to go live at home over the break but I am very scared about it\n",
      "Supporter: Do you feel scared for your own self? Or of the situation in general? I'm sorry to hear that. Relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.\n",
      "Supporter: I'm around college age as well and also live at home. So I can understand your struggle.\n",
      "Seeker: more for the situation in general. i know we will not speak but we will constantly be running into each other, my house is not big.\n",
      "Seeker: and i have no car to escape it\n",
      "Supporter: It's like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it's such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you're not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.\n",
      "Supporter: It'll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets?\n",
      "Seeker: Thank you I appreciate that. I will be fine making it over the thanksgiving break but I am more nervous about covid-19 sending us home for good.\n",
      "Seeker: Not many to be honest. I have a hamster but he is at school with me so nothing at home to go back to\n",
      "Supporter: It sounds like Covid- 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It's such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i'm sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don't want to be.\n",
      "Supporter: Could you bring your hamster home with you? Even the smallest things could help a place feel more loving\n",
      "Seeker: Yes it is very strange and I know that it is a big stressor on all of us, i don't want to sound selfish.\n",
      "Seeker: Yes i am bringing him home with me so that is my little piece of joy that is coming along\n",
      "Supporter: I don't think you're selfish at all. You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and I encourage that behavior!\n",
      "Supporter: Good! I know how hard this situation can be. Very nerve wracking. The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial.\n",
      "Seeker: Well thank you that does help me to feel better. Yes I am happy to bring him home with me and hoping I can have my niece over to intro duce her to him\n",
      "Supporter: You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there\n",
      "Seeker: It is surely my goal! I appreciate your kind words. I would love that if I had a car I could do that but I am not sure how much she will be able to come to my house. I am going to try though!\n",
      "Supporter: Is Uber an option for you? I know there's a lot of rideshare services but they're not always financially reasonable. But that could be a way to get away if you ever need too!\n",
      "Seeker: that is very true i didn't even think of that to be honest! I may use that along the way, thank you for the reminder!\n",
      "Supporter: Sometimes I forget little things like that to help myself whenever I get too involved in the emotional aspect of things. I'm glad I could suggest it to you!\n",
      "Seeker: Thank you! Well i appreciate your help a lot and hope you have a great day!\n"

      "Supporter: I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it\n",

      "Seeker: I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.\n"

      "Supporter: Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER!\n"
